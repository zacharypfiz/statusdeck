## D424 â€“ SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CAPSTONE

By: Zachary Pfizenmaier

Welcome to StatusDeck!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Working with the Database

This project uses the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) to manage database schema changes through migrations.

### Initial Setup

1.  **Link your local environment to your Supabase project.** You will need your project's reference ID, which can be found in the URL of your Supabase dashboard (`https://app.supabase.com/project/<your-project-ref-id>`).

    ```bash
    npx supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref-id>
    ```

    You will be prompted to enter your database password.

### Creating a New Migration

1.  **Create a new migration file.** Use a descriptive name for your migration.

    ```bash
    npx supabase migration new <your_migration_name>
    ```

    This will create a new SQL file in the `supabase/migrations` directory.

2.  **Add your SQL changes.** Open the newly created SQL file and add your `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, or other SQL statements.

3.  **Apply the migration.** To apply the changes to your remote Supabase database, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx supabase db push
    ```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
